The previous AI engineer successfully brought the NÃºcleo Bets application from conception to a functional MVP, adapting significantly to evolving user requirements. Initially, the goal was an AI-powered football analysis site. However, the user pivoted, requesting the removal of all AI/API integration, shifting the focus to a manual analysis platform controlled solely by the admin. The engineer adeptly refactored the application, implementing extensive UI/UX improvements, robust admin controls for user and analysis management, and key features like historical/future analysis filters and Valuable Tips. The core development followed an iterative approach, frequently seeking user feedback and providing live URLs for review. The engineer also initiated the crucial step of preparing for permanent deployment using free services (MongoDB Atlas, Railway, Vercel) after the temporary environment proved unstable, demonstrating foresight and a commitment to product longevity.

The user initially requested an assertive football analysis website leveraging AI for over 85% accuracy, specifically mentioning Sofascore for data and mathematical predictions. The site was named NÃºcleo Bets with a dark blue and neon purple theme. Key initial features included 1X2 predictions, admin-controlled user access, and a section for the admin to post manual palpites (tips) based on recent game history.

**Current State & Implemented Features:**
The requirement for AI integration was explicitly removed. The NÃºcleo Bets application is now a platform for the admin to post and manage football analyses manually.
- **Admin Control:** The admin has absolute power to add, edit, and delete their analyses, as well as add, delete, approve, disapprove, and deactivate regular users.
- **Analysis Management:** Admin can create analyses with various prediction types (Casa, Empate, Fora, Over, Under, Dupla Chance 1, Dupla Chance 2). They can mark these analyses as Green âœ… (correct) or Red ðŸ”´ (incorrect) directly from the dashboard.
- **User Experience:** Users can view the admin's analyses. There are filters to view analyses from Ontem (Yesterday), Hoje (Today), AmanhÃ£ (Tomorrow), and Todos (All).
- **Valuable Tips:** A dedicated, visually distinct section for the admin to post Palpites Valiosos (Valuable Tips), containing multi-game analyses with suggested odds and stake. Users can view these.
- **Access Control:** Regular users are automatically removed after 31 days of registration (admin account is permanent).
- **Navigation & Links:** A left-side menu (accessed by 3 dots) provides links to a Telegram group and Instagram, a password change option for all users, and an exclusive Painel Admin link for administrators.
- **Visuals:** Dark blue and neon purple theme with modern effects, and a custom background image (a neon graph with a soccer ball).
- **Site Title:** NÃºcleo Bets - Sistema de AnÃ¡lises de Futebol.

</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture with a clear separation between frontend and backend.



-   **/app/backend/server.py**: This is the core of the backend, implementing FastAPI. It handles:
    -   User authentication (register, login, JWT generation).
    -   User management endpoints (admin-only: create, delete, approve/disapprove users).
    -   Analysis CRUD operations (create, edit, delete, mark Green/Red) for regular analyses.
    -   Valuable Tips CRUD operations (create, edit, delete) for the specialized tips.
    -   Data retrieval for analyses and valuable tips, with filtering by date.
    -   Automatic user expiration logic (though the actual background job might be external or a task within the app if running permanently).
    -   Initial setup involved basic CRUD and auth. Subsequent modifications added: user management (add/delete/approve), valuable tips, Green/Red status, and the 31-day user expiration logic.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**: The main React component. It orchestrates the entire user interface, including:
    -   Authentication forms (login, register).
    -   Admin dashboard with forms for creating/editing analyses and valuable tips.
    -   User management interface for the admin.
    -   Display of regular analyses with date filters (Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow, All).
    -   Display of Valuable Tips.
    -   Implementation of the sliding sidebar menu with Telegram, Instagram, Change Password, and Admin Panel links.
    -   Handles state management, API calls to the backend, and conditional rendering based on user roles.
    -   Initial setup provided a functional UI. Extensive modifications were made to remove AI integration, add the Green/Red buttons, implement date filters, create the Valuable Tips section, reorganize the header and sidebar, and integrate the background image.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.css**: Contains the application's styling, primarily leveraging Tailwind CSS classes for the dark blue and neon purple theme, glassmorphism effects, and the custom background images. This file was frequently updated to reflect visual changes, including the different background images and component styling.
-   **/app/DEPLOY/** (newly created directory): Contains files prepared for permanent deployment.
    -   : Comprehensive technical guide for deployment.
    -   : Simplified step-by-step instructions for deployment.
    -   : Updated project documentation including new features and credentials.

    -   : Links to YouTube tutorials for deployment services.

-   **Assist with Permanent Deployment:** Guide the user through the process of deploying the NÃºcleo Bets application permanently on free services (MongoDB Atlas, Railway, Vercel). This includes providing the pre-packaged files and walking them through each step.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary request, the previous AI engineer was working on ensuring the site's persistence by preparing it for permanent deployment. The user raised a critical concern about the temporary nature of the current preview environment, which led to a pivot towards setting up a free, permanent hosting solution.

The engineer had just completed the following:
1.  **Backup and Packaging:** A comprehensive backup of the entire codebase was performed. The code was then structured into a  directory, containing all necessary frontend (React) and backend (FastAPI) files, along with detailed markdown guides for deployment.
2.  **Deployment Documentation:** Multiple  files were created within  and  (e.g., , , , , ) to provide the user with clear, step-by-step instructions and resources for self-deployment using free services like MongoDB Atlas, Railway, and Vercel.
3.  **Last Bug Fix:** Before initiating the deployment prep, the engineer successfully resolved a critical bug where Palpites Valiosos (Valuable Tips) created by the admin were not appearing on the analysis screen. This involved checking backend API functionality and correcting potential frontend form submission issues, ensuring the feature was fully functional and visible to users as intended.

The conversation ended with the user confirming their desire for help with the deployment process, and the engineer actively creating the deployable files, even as the temporary site went offline, emphasizing the urgency and importance of getting the site permanently hosted.
